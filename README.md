Background

This project serves to help users calculate personal macronutrient levels for various fitness goals in order to assemble a meal plan entirely of Wendy's items. Initially envisioned to solve the problem of bulking from a fast food menu, the calculator serves to visually demonstrate why this is so difficult when restricted to fast food meals. 

In the Wendy's Dirty Bulkinator, users can:
- select fast food menu items sorted by different macronutrient levels
- build a meal plan from assorted Wendy's menu items
- specify macronutrient levels for their desired plan
- suggest macronutrient levels for a diet or a bulk
- a visualization of macronutrient levels for selected menu items


Technologies, Libraries, APIs
- d3 renders the graph.
- EDAMAM Nutrition Analysis API(https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api) is the source for the nutrition facts of the Wendy's items.
- webpack is used to bundle files for the browser.
- Javascript is used for everything else.
