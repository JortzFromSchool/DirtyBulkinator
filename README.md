Background

This project is dedicated to building a nutrition macro-nutrient calculator from fast food menu items, inspired by the relative ease in which you can fill body-building macros from the Taco Bell Fresca menu. The app will help a user build a meal plan from only fast-food items that fits their specified macro nutrient levels. If possible, the fast food vendor of choice will be Taco Bell.

In the Fast Food Macro Calculator, users will be able to:
- select fast food menu items sorted by different macronutrient levels
- build a meal plan from assorted menu items
- specify macronutrient levels for their desired plan
- suggest macronutrient levels for a diet or a bulk
- display nutrition facts for menu items
- a visualization of macronutrient levels for selected menu items

In addition, this project will include:
- Instructions on how to change values in the calculator and how suggested macronutrient levels are determined
- a README file

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
- d3 for rendering charts
- potentially EDAMAM Nutrition Analysis API(https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api)
- if not, jontonsoup4's Taco Bell as a service API (https://github.com/jontonsoup4/taco-bell-as-a-service)

Implementation Timeline
- Friday/Weekend: Settle on a functional API, build input fields for macros and default levels based on weight and diet goals
- Monday: d3 chart implementation, loading menu item values using DOM Manipulation
- Tuesday: Styling, Animations, Images
- Wednesday: Panicking
- Thursday: Submit!
